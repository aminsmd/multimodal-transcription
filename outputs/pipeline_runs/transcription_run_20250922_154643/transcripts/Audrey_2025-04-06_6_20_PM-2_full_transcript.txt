[00:00 - 00:10] (Visual: The screen is black and there is no audio.)

[00:10 - 00:26] teacher: be rice treats. Okay? We don't want to make sure we have any copywriting issues here. So, he has half a pan of crispy rice treats. He eats half of the treats. What fraction of the pan of crispy rice treats does Harlem eat? I'm going to go ahead and take that away now.

[00:26 - 00:27] (Visual: The teacher turns off the projector, removing the word problem from view.)

[00:27 - 00:32] teacher: I want you to use these sentence stems to help you to turn and talk with your partner. I noticed and what did you notice? Turn and talk.

[00:32 - 00:33] multiple_students: I noticed that [Unintelligible].

[00:33 - 00:50] (Visual: Students are talking amongst themselves in small groups.)

[00:50 - 00:51] teacher: All right, what did we see?

[00:51 - 01:14] (Visual: Students continue talking amongst themselves in small groups. The teacher walks around the classroom, listening to their conversations.)

[01:14 - 01:22] teacher: All right, coming back together in three, two, one, and zero.

[01:22 - 01:28] teacher: All right, I want to affirm my buddies on talking. You did a fabulous job of coming up with what you felt was mathematically important.

[01:28 - 01:36] teacher: Using these stems, I noticed, let's go ahead and share out something that you noticed looking at that question just really fast. Cash.

[01:36 - 01:39] student_A: I noticed that Harlem ate one half.

[01:39 - 01:47] teacher: You noticed that he ate one half. Awesome. Building on to Cash. Cash, go ahead and call on somebody.

[01:47 - 01:49] (Visual: Student raises their hand to be called on.)

[01:49 - 01:52] student_B: I noticed that Harlem had one half.

[01:52 - 01:56] teacher: You noticed that he had one half. Building onto Julieta.

[01:56 - 02:00] (Visual: Student raises their hand to be called on.)

[02:00] student_B: Josephina.

[02:00 - 02:03] student_C: I noticed that he ate one half of a half.

[02:03 - 02:08] teacher: You noticed that he ate one half of a half. Continue calling on.

[02:08 - 02:11] (Visual: A student stands up to speak.)

[02:11 - 02:17] student_D: I noticed that he ate one half of a half of the whole left, which is equal to a fourth.

[02:17 - 02:24] teacher: Huh, so Bryson's already starting to think about calculation shortcuts here. All right, we'll actually sit right next to Anessia so you guys can talk to each other. Awesome.

[02:24 - 02:39] teacher: All right. So, we noticed that Harlem had a half a pan of those crispy rice treats and that he ate half of that pan. I know, crispy rice treats, don't you love it?

[02:39 - 02:40] multiple_students: Yeah.

[02:40 - 02:44] teacher: All right. Now we are going to look for a calculation shortcut.

[02:44 - 03:12] teacher: This is that time where I do not want you writing anything down. As much as you may want to problem solve with paper and pencil, as much as you may want to use your marker and write on your desk, I just want you to put your math hats on. I want you to use your mathematician brain, and I want you to think about if you were going to solve this, what operations might you use? Do you think you can come up with a mathematical shortcut to tell us how much Harlem ate? Turn and talk.

[03:12 - 03:13] multiple_students: Harlem [Unintelligible].

[03:13 - 04:41] (Visual: Students are talking amongst themselves in small groups. The teacher walks around the classroom, listening to their conversations and engaging with different groups.)

[04:41 - 04:51] teacher: Okay. We're getting there. All right, friends. I love the conversation, and I love that we have some misconceptions 'cause that means we get to talk about them.

[04:51 - 05:00] (Visual: The segment ends while the teacher is speaking.)

[05:00 - 05:50] teacher: help me out. So, Harlem, if you didn't know you're eating some crispy rice streets. Those are what they call rice krispie treats in the math world. Um, how much is Harlem starting with? My hand. How much is he going to begin with? Nia? So he's starting with one half and I want you to make this mental image in your head. A half of a pan, right? So, Harlem, do you have the whole pan? No. How much does he have everybody? He has a half of a pan of crispy rice treats. Of that half, how much is Harlem eating? and I'm looking for a new hand that Nia maybe you can call on a friend to build on.

[05:50 - 06:08] student_A: He ate one half of that half.

[06:08 - 06:11] teacher: He ate one half of that half.

[06:11 - 06:36] teacher: And I would love for us to kind of have a conversation. A lot of my friends when we were talking, they said, oh, he ate all of it. Do you agree or disagree? Show me agree that yeah, Harlem ate all of it, or disagree that Harlem did not eat all of it. And Bryson, I'd love if you just call on somebody for me.

[06:36 - 06:41] student_B: Gabriel.

[06:41] teacher: Gabriel?

[06:41 - 07:07] student_C: Um, I I believe that he did not eat all of it because it says that he ate half of the half. So one half times one half equals one fourth because one times one equals one, but two times two equals four, so he ate one fourth of the half of a pan.

[07:07 - 07:26] teacher: And so Gabriel is working to now come up with a calculation shortcut. He's thinking that he knows that we're starting with one one half of a pan. He knows that he's looking for one half of that one half. And what does of mean exactly?

[07:26 - 07:28] multiple_students: Times. Oh, it means multiply.

[07:28 - 07:40] teacher: So gave use that vocabulary of the word of, and he said that his mathematical shortcut would be to just multiply what? Can you give me some math terms to kind of help us to understand how you multiplied? You multiplied what?

[07:40 - 07:49] student_C: I multiplied one half by one half and got the product of one fourth.

[07:49 - 07:53] teacher: So, what I heard is that you multiplied those top numbers are your

[07:53 - 07:55] student_C: um, numerators.

[07:55 - 07:58] teacher: So you multiplied your numerators and then you multiplied your

[07:58 - 08:00] student_C: denominators.

[08:00 - 08:07] teacher: And so Gabriel says that Harlem ate one fourth of the crispy rice treats. Bryson, I I see you agreeing. Go ahead.

[08:07 - 08:17] student_B: So we know that it's one fourth, but we use but we used another one. We divided. We divided one half divided by two.

[08:17 - 08:22] teacher: So you did one half and you divided it by two.

[08:22 - 08:25] teacher: And when you say divided by two, why did you choose to do that?

[08:25 - 08:26] teacher: Josephina if you want to build on.

[08:26 - 08:40] student_D: Because, because one half is equal to two fourths. So then because they ate half the half, one half of two fourths is equal to one fourth.

[08:40 - 08:52] teacher: So, yeah. And so the word that comes to my mind when I'm thinking about what you both did is you partitioned, right? You took that half and you partitioned into another half. And I think that's a great strategy and I think it connects really well to Gabe's.

[08:52 - 09:19] teacher: Okay. So looking and moving forward, the best part about this is when we're going through this, you were able to come up with a calculation shortcut. Okay? And now I really want to reflect on our learning and think about how could we use this calculation shortcut going forward.

[09:19 - 09:26] teacher: So the next time if you had a problem like this where you have a fraction times a fraction, the next time I will before I calculate because

[09:26 - 09:30] teacher: or paying attention to blank is helpful because

[09:30 - 09:34] teacher: Turn and talk with your partner and use one of those sentence stems to reflect on your contemplation and calculation. Turn and talk.

[09:34 - 10:00] multiple_students: [Unintelligible] I'm gonna do the next time. I'm going to calculate. [Unintelligible] Why do you think it would be helpful to look deeper at your question? [Unintelligible]

[10:00 - 10:01] student_A: half what?

[10:01 - 10:10] teacher: And Austin, that was a misconception that a lot of people had and I'm really glad that you pointed that out because your reflection on your learning is going to be really helpful.

[10:10 - 10:14] teacher: A lot of people said he ate it all. And that was because as we were looking at this,

[10:14] (Visual: A student in a yellow shirt raises their right hand holding a blue card with the letter 'D' on it.)

[10:14 - 10:22] teacher: and we're introduced to looking at a half of a half, it really was something new and as you look deeper into that question, that's really going to help you to learn.

[10:22 - 10:24] teacher: Thanks for sharing, Austin.

[10:24 - 10:31] teacher: All right. Don't worry, I'm gonna give you your pencils back now. We are going to transition into our next part of the lesson. I'm very excited to do this with you.

[10:31 - 10:40] teacher: I'm going to pause for just a second so we can pass out materials, and then we're going to get started looking at unit fraction by unit fraction multiplication.
