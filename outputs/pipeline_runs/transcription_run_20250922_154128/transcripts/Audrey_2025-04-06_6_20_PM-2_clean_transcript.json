No. How much does he have everybody? He has a half of a pan of crispy rice treats. Of that half, how much is Harlem eating? And I'm looking for a new hand that Nia maybe you can call on a friend to build on. He ate one half of it. He ate one half of that half. And I would love for us to kind of have a conversation. A lot of my friends when we were talking, they said, oh, he ate all of it. Do you agree or disagree? Show me agree that yeah, Harlem made all of it or disagree that Harlem did not eat all of it.
