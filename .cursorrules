# Cursor Rules for Multimodal Transcription Project

## Virtual Environment Activation
- Always activate the .venv virtual environment in the root directory before running any Python code
- Use `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
- Ensure all Python commands are run within the activated virtual environment

## Python Code Execution
- When running Python scripts, always ensure the virtual environment is activated first
- Use `python` command after activation, not `python3` unless specifically required
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` within the activated environment

## Project Structure
- Main source code is in the `src/` directory
- Examples are in the `examples/` directory
- Outputs are stored in the `outputs/` directory
- Test outputs are in the `test_outputs/` directory

## Development Guidelines
- Always check if virtual environment is activated before running any Python code
- Use relative paths when possible, but absolute paths are acceptable for tool calls
- Follow the existing project structure and naming conventions
